# Privacy Policy for Link Cleaner

Link Cleaner is committed to respecting your privacy and being transparent about the collected data. This policy outlines what information is transmitted during the installation and use of Link Cleaner, how it is used, and how you can control the collection.

## Information collected by Link Cleaner

Link Cleaner uses the privacy-friendly Plausible Analytics, which is subject to the [Plausible Analytics Privacy Policy](https://plausible.io/privacy). The data includes many times the app is open, how long it is used, browser and platform information, and the current region. The data is anonymized by Plausible Analytics. For example, your IP address is not visible to the developers of Link Cleaner.

Link Cleaner does not automatically collect or transmit any web links. The link cleaning function runs in your web browser, without sending the URLs to an external server, and the QR code feature also runs locally using [EasyQRCodeJS](https://github.com/ushelp/EasyQRCodeJS). If you click one of the share buttons, the URL is provided to the selected service.

## How Link Cleaner uses your information

Link Cleaner uses analytics data to determine which device types and web browsers are used the most often, which helps prioritize development. The data can also help identify problems with certain platforms.

The analytics data is stored in Plausible Analytics and is not shared or sold.
